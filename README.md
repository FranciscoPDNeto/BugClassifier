# IssueClassifier

This project has as main goal to produce a good classifier for issues inside Github repositories.
The classifier, at start, will gonna classify between just three categories, the main ones, those are bugs, features and issues related to documentation.
To achieve that goal, it will be used a bunch of machine learning algorithms, specially those of Natural language programming, to identify the patterns of the issues.

To mining that data to train and validate the models, it will be used the api of Github in python.
